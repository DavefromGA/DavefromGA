- Hi, I’m @DavefromGA
- I’m interested in learning about Linux and writing some python code eventually.
- I’m currently learning how to write scripts in the shell and just getting started really.

- I’m looking to collaborate on a small pet project to get a chromebox to run ubuntu and use a graphics card in one of the mini-pcie slots for testing.
-   I have it running ubuntu so far and I have been trying different hardware approached to get it to see the gpu, but have not been successful yet.
-   I think it will work since I have used MrChromeBox's tools to get it to let me in this far, just need to get it to see the gpu next.

- You can reach me by email at georgiaphotog @ gmail .com (pull out the spaces...) Thank you if you have already solved this mystery, I would like to
-   know how you did it!
